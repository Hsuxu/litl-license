## History

The LITL License was originally created by [Eloy Durán][] ([@alloy][]):

[@alloy]: https://github.com/alloy

https://github.com/license-in-three-lines

As the original appears to have been abandoned (dead domain and no activity
since 2010), I ([Stuart P. Bentley][] / [@stuartpb][]) forked it to a new
organization, with the goal of reviving this license with a renewed focus on
usability and accessibility.

Note that there is no year in the "copyright" line of the license: as the
license effectively relinquishes the holder's reserved rights, such a
statement of effective date would be [superfluous][].
